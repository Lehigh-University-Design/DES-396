# Interactive Data Visualization

Graphical representation of information is a vital area of design pertaining to the distillation of data into insightful visual form. This course investigates methods and technologies useful to the organization, perceptual interface and visual narrative of complex information. Focusing on data as creative medium, students will progress through a series of projects that engage and interpret contemporary contexts with charts, diagrams, graphs, maps and text. Project development will consist of sketches, wireframes and interactive design with javascript.

## Course Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand, read and discuss visualization history, technique and theory.
- Discover, explore, interpreit and clean datasets.
- Understand and troubleshoot structured data.
- Research, conceptualize, design and critique visualizations.  
- Know and understand best practices for technically and conceptually approaching contemporary visualization challenges.
- Know the landscape of current frameworks, tools and resources, and know when to choose one tool over another.  
- Develop a typographically sound and graphically rich data visualization project.

## Acknowledging Lenapehoking

Lehigh University resides on Lenapehoking (leh-NA-pe-ho-king), the traditional home of the Lenni Lenape. We acknowledge this territory once also served as a hunting ground, trade exchange point, and migration route for the Munsee (MUHN-see), Susquehannock (suh-skwuh-HA-naak), Haudenosaunee (ho-den-no-SHOW-nee), and many other Indigenous peoples. We recognize, support, and advocate for Indigenous peoples who live here now, and for those who were (and continue to be) forcibly removed. We acknowledge, honor, and respect the past, present, and future of the diverse Indigenous peoples connected to this land, whose presence continues in the region due to their resilience in the face of colonization.
