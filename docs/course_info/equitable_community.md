# Course Information

## The Principles of Our Equitable Community

Lehigh University endorses [The Principles of Our Equitable Community](http://www.lehigh.edu/~inprv/initiatives/PrinciplesEquity_Sheet_v2_032212.pdf). We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.

### Instructor's Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that studentsâ€™ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diverse perspectives students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.
