# Course Information

## Course Dynamic

This course is a 4-credit course, which means that in addition to the scheduled meeting times, students are expected to complete at least 9.5 hours of course-related work outside
of class each week during the semester. This includes time spent completing assigned readings, participating in lab sessions, studying for tests and examinations, preparing assignments and project work, and other course-related tasks.

Important: This is a studio course which requires substantial time and effort invested especially during the class sessions. In many instances lost class time, for whatever reason and even when excusable, is impossible to make up. 

Arriving to class more then 15 minutes late is considered an absence. Leaving class early without the professorâ€™s permission is considered an absence. Not having required materials after the first week of the classes can result in the student dismissal from the class.

MISSING 3 CLASSES WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL WILL RESULT IN THE DEDUCTION OF ONE LETTER GRADE FROM THE FINAL EARNED GRADE. MISSING 4 OR MORE CLASSES WILL RESULT IN THE STUDENT FAILING THE CLASS.
