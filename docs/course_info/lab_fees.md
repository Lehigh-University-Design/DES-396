# Course Information

## Lab Fees

Lab fees for this and other designated courses in the Department of Art, Architecture and Design are set at $150 per student. They provide funding for many of the consumable materials, supplies, and services provided for your use in the course. Most of these are purchased on your behalf at quantity discounts that would be unavailable if purchasing the materials individually. Depending on the class, lab fees may also provide for specialized design software accessible to you in the department’s PC and Mac labs, and through remote use in the virtualization of those computer terminals. Those classes that utilize the university’s Design Labs will have a portion of their fee directed to cover materials and other shop consumables such as blades, abrasives and adhesives. In courses that include site visits to off-campus locations, lab fees may also cover some or all the cost of group travel and transportation. 

In this course, the majority of the lab fee is budgeted for: design software accessible to you in the department’s PC and Mac labs.

The lab fee will provide the minimum required for the successful completion of the course. However, throughout the semester, you may also need to purchase additional materials and supplies on your own.  What you decide to purchase and how much you spend will vary depending on the design choices you make. Spending more money may not make for a better project, although sometimes a good idea requires an investment to see it through. More likely, it will require time and effort rather than money.  It is recommended that total additional out of pocket expenses for this course be kept to less than $100.
