# Course Information

## Reading

Most of the readings in the [schedule](/schedule.html) of this syllabus are listed as suggestions for learning more and are intended to augment material covered in this *studio* course. Any student who would like to take a deeper dive into data visualization history, theory and technique (and thus enrich their own approach to creative data visualization design practice) is encouraged to find time to read as much of the recommended readings as possible.  

Some reading material will be especially important for following lectures and generating discussion. The instructor will be sure to emphasize any critically important or required reading at the appropriate time in class.
