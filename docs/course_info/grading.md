# Course Information

## Grading

Your final grade is based on: the evaluation of your overall weight: course performance stated under “responsibilities” and computed according to the following breakdown and schema. Details of the assessment are explained in the “grading rubric.”

### Grading Definition

Course grades are A, A–, B+, B, B–, C+, C, C–, D+, D, D–, P, F, N, SP, X, Z. The meaning of each grade is as follows: A, A–, excellent; B+, B, and B–, good; C+ and C, competent; C–, continuation competency (the student has achieved the level of proficiency needed for the course to satisfy prerequisite requirements); D+, D, and D–, passing, but performance is not adequate to take any subsequent course which has this course as a prerequisite.  P, pass-fail grading with a grade equivalent to D– or higher; F, failing; N or SP, incomplete; X, absent from the final examination; Z, absent from the final examination and incomplete.
