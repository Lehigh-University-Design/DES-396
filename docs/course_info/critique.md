# Course Information

## Critique

Critique is an essential tool for communicating, improving and evaluating work of art or design. Not being familiar with process of critiquing yours or your fellow students’ work will impair your creative ability and growth in this and other art classes. It is important to understand that critique is and should always be directed towards the work itself, and not to the person. It should always be objective, honest and well intended. All participants in the critiquing process should understand that the critique is integral to growth and improvement, even though it may be difficult to receive and sometimes could lead to emotional responses and miscommunication. Reading and practicing critiquing work will equip you with the tools necessary for successful completion of this class.

It is strongly suggested for all students to obtain and read
