# Acknowledgment

## Acknowledging Lenapehoking

Lehigh University resides on Lenapehoking (leh-NA-pe-ho-king), the traditional home of the Lenni Lenape. We acknowledge this territory once also served as a hunting ground, trade exchange point, and migration route for the Munsee (MUHN-see), Susquehannock (suh-skwuh-HA-naak), Haudenosaunee (ho-den-no-SHOW-nee), and many other Indigenous peoples. We recognize, support, and advocate for Indigenous peoples who live here now, and for those who were (and continue to be) forcibly removed. We acknowledge, honor, and respect the past, present, and future of the diverse Indigenous peoples connected to this land, whose presence continues in the region due to their resilience in the face of colonization.
