# Acknowledgment

## Acknowledging Lenapehoking

Lehigh University resides on [Lenapehoking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenapehoking), widely translated as 'homelands of the Lenape', which in the 16th and 17th centuries, ranged along the Eastern seaboard from western Connecticut to Delaware, and encompassed the territory adjacent to the Delaware and lower Hudson river valleys, and the territory between them. We acknowledge that this territory also once served as a hunting ground, trade exchange point, and migration route for the Munsee, Susquehannock, Haudenosaunee, and other Indigenous peoples. We recognize, support, and advocate for Indigenous peoples who live here now, who were forcibly removed, and who have returned. We acknowledge, honor, and respect the past, present, and future of the diverse Indigenous peoples connected to this land, whose presence continues in the region due to their resilience in the face of colonization.
